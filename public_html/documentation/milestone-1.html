<h1>Persona</h1>
<h3>As a user, I need to make sure I show quality work so customers want to to hire me for commissioned work.</h3>
<p>Name: Marcus Narro</p>
<p>Age: 37</p>
<img src="Marcus-photo.jpg">
<p>Job: Full time project coordinator at Lowe's while trying to start up a side-gig doing commissioned woodwork.</p>
<p>Technology: Windows power user. Uses Microsoft Surface laptop, Mozilla Firefox, and Samsung Galaxy S10</p>
<p>Behaviors & attitudes:Works full-time currently but has time on the weekends for his side-gig. The woodshop he works out of was his grandfather’s, so it has a lot of sentimental value and he loves spending time there. Marcus has a passion for woodworking and doesn’t look at it as a side job but rather his dream. He is just starting out so is eager to share his passion and work with the community. He has a large network and knows a decent amount of people in Albuquerque since he grew up here. He is not a huge social media user but will post pictures of his work from time to time, especially when he’s created something new.</p>
<p>Frustrations & needs: Marcus wishes the shop was a little closer but it’s not a huge deal. He shares the woodshop with his uncle, who owns the bigger tools. Sometimes his uncle gets pretty picky about the way Marcus uses the tools so he doesn’t have free range of everything. </p>
<p>Goals for the site: Marcus's goal is to show the products he has made, get more exposure and attract clients. He would also like to eventually try to generate decent income from this side-gig.</p>
